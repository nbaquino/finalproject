  - For Mac, you can install g++ by running `brew install gcc`
- Before compiling the program, make sure to navigate to the directory src by running `cd src`
- To compile the program into executable, run in the terminal `g++ -o  LOGIC .\Logic.cpp .\Scanner.cpp .\Parser.cpp .\Evaluator.cpp`
- To run the program, run in the terminal `./LOGIC.exe`
- In this case, since the program is already compiled, you can directly run the program by running `./LOGIC.exe`
